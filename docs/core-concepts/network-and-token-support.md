# Network & Token Support

This page explains which blockchain networks and tokens are supported by x402, and how to extend support to additional networks.

## Overview

x402 is designed to work across multiple blockchain networks, with different levels of support depending on the facilitator being used. The protocol itself is network-agnostic, but facilitators need to implement network-specific logic for payment verification and settlement.

### Supported Facilitators

Network support in x402 depends on which facilitator you use. Here are the currently available facilitators:

#### x402.org Facilitator

* **Supports**: Base Sepolia, Solana Devnet
* **Notes**: Recommended for testing and development. This is the default facilitator in the x402 packages and requires no setup.
* **URL**: https://x402.org/facilitator

#### CDP's x402 Facilitator

* **Supports**: Base, Base Sepolia, Solana, Solana Devnet
* **Notes**: Production-ready for mainnet payments with KYT/OFAC compliance checks. Can also be used for testing on Base Sepolia. Requires CDP API keys. Uses facilitator object instead of facilitator URL.
* **Requirements**: CDP account and API keys from [cdp.coinbase.com](https://cdp.coinbase.com), see Quickstart for Sellers: Running on Mainnet for more details.

#### x402.rs Facilitator

* **Supports**: Base Sepolia, Base, XDC Mainnet
* **Notes**: Rust-based facilitator operated by the x402 community.
* **URL**: https://facilitator.x402.rs

#### PayAI Facilitator

* **Supports**: Solana, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, Sei, Peaq, Iotex and all of their testnets.
* **Notes**: Production-ready for mainnet payments. Supports all tokens on Solana, supports EIP-3009 tokens on EVM-Based chains.
* **URL**: https://facilitator.payai.network

#### Self-Hosted Facilitators

* **Supports**: Any EVM network
* **Notes**: Run your own facilitator for full control and customization. Supports networks like Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, and other EVM-compatible chains.
* **Setup**: See "Adding Support for New Networks" section below

#### Third-Party Facilitators

Additional facilitators may be available from external providers. Check the [x402 Discord community](https://discord.gg/cdp) for the latest facilitator offerings.

### Token Support

x402 supports tokens on both EVM and Solana networks:

* **EVM**: Any ERC-20 token that implements the EIP-3009 standard
* **Solana**: Any SPL or token-2022 token

**Important**: Facilitators support networks, not specific tokens — any EIP-3009 compatible token works on EVM networks, and any SPL/token-2022 token works on Solana, for the facilitators that support those networks.

#### EVM: EIP-3009 Requirement

Tokens must implement the `transferWithAuthorization` function from the EIP-3009 standard. This enables:

* **Gasless transfers**: The facilitator sponsors gas fees
* **Signature-based authorization**: Users sign transfer authorizations off-chain
* **Secure payments**: Transfers are authorized by cryptographic signatures

#### Specifying Payment Amounts

When configuring payment requirements, you have two options:

1. **Price String** (e.g., `"$0.01"`) - The system infers USDC as the token
2. [**TokenAmount**](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/094dcd2b95b5e13e8673264cc026d080417ee142/typescript/packages/x402/src/types/shared/middleware.ts#L28) - Specify exact atomic units of any EIP-3009 token

#### Using Custom EIP-3009 Tokens

To use a custom EIP-3009 token, you need three key pieces of information:

1. **Token Address**: The contract address of your EIP-3009 token
2. **EIP-712 Name**: The token's name for EIP-712 signatures
3. **EIP-712 Version**: The token's version for EIP-712 signatures

**Finding Token Information on Basescan**

You can retrieve the required EIP-712 values from any block explorer:

1. **Name**: Read the `name()` function - [Example on Basescan](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913#readProxyContract#F16)
2. **Version**: Read the `version()` function - [Example on Basescan](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913#readProxyContract#F24)

These values are used in the `eip712` nested object when configuring TokenAmount:

```typescript
{
  eip712: {
    name: "USD Coin",    // From name() function
    version: "2"         // From version() function
  }
}
```

#### Solana: SPL Tokens & Token 2022 Tokens

On Solana, x402 supports all SPL tokens and Token 2022 tokens. When using facilitators that support Solana or Solana Devnet, payments can be made in any SPL/token-2022 token, including USDC (SPL). No EIP-712 configuration is required on Solana.

#### USDC - The Default Token

* **Status**: Supported by default across all networks
* **Why**: USDC implements EIP-3009 and is widely available
* **Networks**: Available on Base, Base Sepolia, and all supported networks

#### Why EIP-3009?

The EIP-3009 standard is essential for x402 because it enables:

1. **Gas abstraction**: Buyers don't need native tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc.) for gas
2. **One-step payments**: No separate approval transactions required
3. **Universal facilitator support**: Any EIP-3009 token works with any facilitator

**Note**: On EVM networks, facilitators support any EIP-3009 compatible token; on Solana, facilitators support any SPL/Token-2022 token.

### Adding Support for New Networks

There are two ways to add support for new EVM networks in x402:

#### Option 1: Contributing to x402 Packages

You can add official network support by submitting a PR to the x402 repository. This makes your network available to all x402 users.

**Files to Modify**

1.  **`typescript/packages/x402/src/types/shared/evm/config.ts`**

    Add your network's chain ID and USDC address:

    ```typescript
    // Example: Adding Avalanche networks
    "43113": {  // Avalanche Fuji testnet chain ID
      usdcAddress: "0x5425890298aed601595a70AB815c96711a31Bc65",
      usdcName: "USD Coin",
    },
    "43114": {  // Avalanche mainnet chain ID
      usdcAddress: "0xB97EF9Ef8734C71904D8002F8b6Bc66Dd9c48a6E",
      usdcName: "USDC",
    },
    ```
2.  **`typescript/packages/x402/src/types/shared/network.ts`**

    Add your network to the schema and mappings:

    ```typescript
    // Update the NetworkSchema enum
    export const NetworkSchema = z.enum(["base-sepolia", "base", "avalanche-fuji", "avalanche"]);

    // Add to SupportedEVMNetworks array
    export const SupportedEVMNetworks: Network[] = [
      "base-sepolia",
      "base",
      "avalanche-fuji",
      "avalanche",
    ];

    // Add to EvmNetworkToChainId mapping
    ["avalanche-fuji", 43113],
    ["avalanche", 43114],
    ```
3.  **`typescript/packages/x402/src/types/shared/evm/wallet.ts` - Update `getChainFromNetwork` function**

    Add your network to the `getChainFromNetwork` function to map your network string to the viem chain object:

    ```typescript
    import { avalanche, avalancheFuji } from "viem/chains";

    // Add your network to the switch statement in getChainFromNetwork
    case "avalanche":
      return avalanche;
    case "avalanche-fuji":
      return avalancheFuji;
    ```

**Key Requirements**

* **Network key**: Use a consistent network identifier (e.g., `avalanche-fuji`) across all files
* **Viem chain**: Your network must be available in viem/chains or you'll need to define it manually
* **USDC address**: Must be EIP-3009 compatible (has `transferWithAuthorization` function)
* **Chain ID**: Use your network's official chain ID in the config
* **Consistency**: Ensure the network name matches across `NetworkSchema`, `SupportedEVMNetworks`, `EvmNetworkToChainId`, and the `getChainFromNetwork` switch statement

#### Option 2: Running Your Own Facilitator

If you need immediate support or want to test before contributing, you can run your own facilitator.
